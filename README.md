# Pencil vs Pen Image Classification (PyTorch)

# This project scans an image of a pen or pencil and determines which writing utensil is in the image. 

This project was largely built on Google Collabs with PyTorch. It utilizes CNN Neural Networks along with pre-processing to scan images and make predictions. The CNN Neural Network is trained on a Dataset of 280 images of Pens and Pencils. I created this dataset myself by taking pictures of pens and pencils from different angles, lighting conditions, and surfaces.
